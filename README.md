<h1 align="center">Chaster; A Great Platform That Does Not Care</h1>

> This is going to be be a very long read, there is a [TLDR](https://github.com/shy-foxo/chaster-is-an-unsafe-platform) at the bottom.

Chaster is a Chasity lock holding website, arguably one of the best ones out there. Between it's user friendly UI, useful features and games, the ability to work across PC and mobile devices, it's no wounder it has gained massive popularity. However, not everything is rainbows and sunshine. Chaster lacks some basic user safety tools and in one case, a moderator has even stated they do not want safety features added. Lets talk about it!

<h1 align="center">The Lack of a Blocking Function</h1>

One of the many great things about Chaster is its plethora community and intractable lock features. From shared links that other users or guests can vote to add or remove time on, to a verification system that lets users vote to verify you are still locked, and even a pillory where users vote to either add time or on what tasks you should complete. Given Chaster's size one might think their is a way to stop certain users from interacting with you and your lock right? Outside of the "ignore conversation" button for user chats, their is no way to stop users from interacting with you or your locks.

Is there anything users can do at all? For the shared links function, users can see who added or removed time so, in theory users could simply reverse the action of users they do not want interacting with their lock. This is far from ideal however, not only can it be taxing to the user, users can vote once every 24 hours. Nor is their even an option to reset the link for users to vote on! The only other option in this case would be to just flat out disable the feature.

Verification photos and pillory is even worse. Their is NO way at all to see who voted for what. This means that users you do not want interacting with you can interact all they please with no way for you to find out they are even doing so. While one could disable these features altogether, this is at best temporary fix and ignores the underlying issue. Users should be able to control what users can and can not interact with them.

Shared locks are much the same story, this feature allows users to pre make locks that can be shared privately or publicly. Their is an option to require a password to start a shared lock but this only goes so far. If a shared lock is public, any user can join them at any time. Their is nothing you can do to stop only specific users from joining them. You can effectively end a lock once a user starts it, however their is nothing preventing the user from starting the lock again. Being forced to use a password on your shared locks not only increases friction to start a shared lock, but in some cases can ruin the whole idea of the lock. Take for example trap locks, the idea behind these is you join for a short amount of time and hope you get out before the lock creator finds and "traps" you. If you need to ask for a password to even start the lock.. well then they will know you plan to join it effectively ruining the whole game.

The idea of a blocking function is not a new idea to Chaster either. From what I can find, the earliest someone suggested adding a blocking feature was on 1/25/22, thats over one year ago! The topic of being able to stop specific users from interacting with certain element's of the lock has come up many times before then. On Chasters own feedback site their are two posts, one from 9 months ago and one from 5 months ago asking for a blocking function. While it might be understandable that a blocking feature would not exist in a beta, Chaster is no longer considering itself to be a beta, more on this later. 

![user asking for blocking feature on 1/25/22](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/833171605366243330/1121883459875516497/Discord_vSRvuRuHgt.png)

![2nd post created 5 months ago also asking for a blocking feature](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/833171605366243330/1121883805498736661/brave_G6d7n56oVG.png)

To make matters worse chaster is not even a new platform! From Vince's words "Chaster is now online for two and a half years, and has grown significantly, faster than I expected." Who is Vince you might ask? "I'm (Vince) the only active developer. Aaron is working with me on technical stuff and hosting, but I'm the only one working on the code as of today." I have talked with Vince a few times about the lack of a blocking function and here is what he has had to say: 

!["Hi! To reply to your message on general chat: we plan to work on new social profile features in Q4 this year (improving user profile, add additional fields), and we plan during this project to add a real blocking system. It's not trivial to create this system as we need to block every interaction (pillory, votes, session link, messaging, profile display, locks). For information, this project has some technical requirements that we plan to do earlier in Q3 (new search system), that's why we don't have a blocking system yet.
But it's planned in our internal roadmap, and obviously it's an important feature for a messaging app."](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/833171605366243330/1121886780371767326/brave_tBxj1eSTuM.png)

![A longer message going into more details, tldr, "I am the only active dev, we are planning to add it but its not easy to make and I plan to make a few functions first before we add this"](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/833171605366243330/1121887523124281364/brave_xAbNQz5LNL.png)

So, despite all of the requests and the need for a blocking system, its not planned until Q4 2023. Yikes! Their are a few other points I want to break down here.

> "However we need to address some tech requirements firsts, **including the search system to improve performance**, as I'm sure you don't want a blocking system with a laggy experience."

This one strikes me as very strange. For starters, from my understand he is talking about the search function that can be found inside the chat section of the website. From my experience the search bar works just fine. Not fast, not perfect but just acquit. The second is "I'm sure you don't want a blocking system with a laggy experience." Their is already an ignore user function, why cant a block user option be added right below it? Most users will probably have some kind of interaction with the user they wish to block anyways. Adding a block option in the chat window and or user profiles it should be easy to find the user based on a previous or current interaction and block them. If not, you can still use the search bar to try to find users. I just do not understand this logic behind why the search system needs to be improved before adding this.

I can understand that adding a blocking system can take time do to the many elements that would need to work with it. Their has been plenty of time to shift development into working on these features instead. Over a year in fact, but his current plan is still not prioritize this and put it after other features later this year. If he truly understands the importance of it why has nothing been done sooner? Why is it still not a top priority? Even one of the lead moderators has stated "Yup. I agree it's sorely needed. But not that it's the literal highest priority". It would seem no matter how much feedback or need their is "I'm sure I'm (Vince) better placed to know what to prioritize on the app I'm developing." It is incredibly frustrating. Here was my response to him:

![Me suggesting the simple logic in my head on how to go about solving this](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/833171605366243330/1121892855925968990/brave_AdIlD6FcFQ.png)

I can not give a follow up to this because Vince never responded back to this message.

The Chaster team likes to point to the moderation team as the current solution this problem but the moderation team is not the end all be all. A prime example of this is how integrated Chaster is with Discord. This means that a lot of activities and chatting are off the Chaster platform. This in turn makes it harder for the moderation team to take action on cases that might take place outside of the platform. While reporting problematic users is still important, letting users have control over their own accounts and letting them control who and who can not interact with them is paramount.

Chaster knows this is a problem, not only have they acknowledged it they also recently made a post warning users about bad actors on the platform.

![Post warning about bad actors on the platform](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/833171605366243330/1121897449452216350/Discord_e22Ez0Qft2.png)

And yet, the ability for users to take control and block users is only a promise to come later this year  This is despite the fact users have been asking for it for over a year.

<h1 align="center">The Lack of an Emergency Unlock</h1>

When you create a lock on Chaster you are presented with 2 options, upload an image or create a combination.

![Screen shot showing the prompt above](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/833171605366243330/1121898958713802824/brave_PnFtoVw6yE.png)

This is because Chaster assumes you have some means to lock your keys up with, normally this is done with a lock box. This is all fine and dandy right? If you create a lock with your keys locked away surely their is a method to unlock yourself in an emergency right? Wrong! This function does not exist at all. It has been suggested before:

![user suggesting emergency unlock option](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/833171605366243330/1121901025079599165/brave_3MCFEW3HSJ.png)

But this suggestion was denied, because it will be abused by people not serious about Chastity! I can understand that this suggestion is not perfect because it leaves the lock "frozen" instead of ending it. Currently, if you end your lock early, Chaster labels it as "Abandoned" and will NOT return your lock code. Your only options around this is to rely on a hygiene opening as your emergency unlock, make an alt account and give it keyholder permissions to let yourself out, or ask the Chaster moderation team for the code. 

Surely Chaster lets you select no option at all right? Wrong! In fact, someone else suggested this and wouldn't you know it, that suggest was also denied.

![The above suggestion](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/833171605366243330/1121904989246332969/brave_gsVMC2TXxD.png)

This infuriates me. This is not a "very edge case". Lots of users, I would argue probably most, get a lock box *after* they get a cage or other Chasity device. Assuming that everyone has a method to lock their keys up is bonkers. If anything, wouldn't inexperienced users need the option to unlock at a moments notice __even more__ then an experienced user? Coding wise, the only thing that should be stopping this from existing is removing the code as a requirement to start a lock and making sure the program can expect no code when it would normally show the user a code. That's about it.

At the very least, it is good that their is the option of going to the moderator team to ask for a code if need be. It is worth mentioning that reaching out to the moderation team is not very clearly listed anywhere. But why not having an emergency release system in the first place is absolutely beyond me. It is a strange omission from a platform that claims "the security of our users is indeed our top priority" as quoted by Vince. However, I will mention they are planning on adding an emergency unlock option with a password. This would be fine, expect it has been in their backlog for **over 2 years**. On top of this, one of the head mods of Chaster does not even think it should be an option at all.

![The suggestion on their feedbacks site asking for an emergency password](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/833171605366243330/1121914696325406862/brave_hmBfNkJDKO.png)

"nor do I like the idea of any sort of emergency unlock" This absolutely infuriates me! Chaster is a public platform, so it is understandable that people from all experience levels will be using the platform. I do not think something for emergency use should be monetized but I fully agree with LycraShortzUK here. Not only should this already be a feature but the fact that a moderator from Chaster thinks it should not exist at all is quite frankly gross. This is ironic given that this is the mod who sings the praises of "Safe, Sane, Consensual." It is also bold to assume all users have access to another breakable lock for emergency's when quite frankly, not all users have access to a lock box as is. I know a friend who left the platform over the lack of this feature, and not to mention, at least 99 other users felt this suggestion was worth an upvote. But yet, after being on their radar for 2 years, it still is not implemented.

Lastly, I want to mention the option to submit your own code is "planned". This can be used to submit photos of your keys or cage locked with a single use sealed lock with a random string on it. However I can not seem to find this again, if you do find it, please let me know so I can update this page!

<h1 align="center">The Handling of Findom Locks</h1>

Another recent issue Chaster has had has been Findom locks. If you have no idea what a Findom is, that is okay! The first screen shot gives a good explainer of what a Findom is better then I can explain it.

![findom explained from the urban dictionary](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/833171605366243330/1121936387558608907/brave_BrzA2JswBR.png)

And here is how Chaster is handling the problem: 

![Chaster's announcement about how they are handling it, this can be found on their website under the change log tab](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/833171605366243330/1121936612390092850/Discord_PP9mWkzFxG.png)

I will be upfront and say that I am not into Findom and I have not used Chaster for the past few months for the reasons listed above and below. I am however a bit septical about how they are handling this, mainly this part: 

![Findoms are required to be apart of chaster plus](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/833171605366243330/1122644847279480912/brave_cBu1ksPGlJ.png)

If their is money to be made, then buying Chaster plus is just the cost of doing business. I say this because this feels like the move [twitter did with the blue check mark](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2022/11/14/twitter-parody-accounts-cause-chaos/10696646002/). If a scammer needs to spend a little money to make a lot of money tghen this is just the cost of doing businesses. In turn, this also might make the scammers harder to tell from real Findoms because users might think that every user who pays for Chaster Plus is a legitimate Findom. 

Solving this issue this way just feels rushed and I am unsure this is the best option to tackle this issue. This could be seen as a better approach then outright banning the Findoms from using the platform but, Chaster is still really restrictive about it. They also state that if a marked Findom reaches out to you first, then they could get their account terminated. I asked a friend of mine who does Findom sometimes and their opinion on the matter? Not only did they stay "its stupid" but they also agreed that bad actors can pay for Chaster plus and that it might cause users to mistake them as trust worthy Findoms.

Not to mention you could pay for Chaster plus and have no one even use any of your locks. Nor could you reach out to other users for risk of being terminated. I do think making locks more clear that they are Findom locks is a good change. Only time will tell if this change works out as intended as currently the deadline has not been reached. If you want to learn more about these changes I highly recommend looking at their [documentation and faq](https://docs.chaster.app/locks/findom/) on the subject.

<h1 align="center">Chaster's Lack of Communication</h1>

Chaster also has been lacking good communication especially from the development team. For example, a lot of these augments could be countered with the site is still in beta. Expect... its not. When this change was made I am honestly not sure, it was seemly changed overnight. All I can say is it happened between April 18 2022 and June 4th 2023. 

![Chaster's change log with the dates pointed out](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/833171605366243330/1121970530816368750/k16X0XOvdI.png)

What happened between update 0.24 and beta 12.5 is anyone's guess. You would think that moving out of beta would be huge news or at least worthy of some kind of announcement but their has been none at all. As for why this changed was made overnight with no announcement is only something I can guess at. Presumably this was to make the platform feel more finished and to feel like you are truly buying into a service and not a early beta. But as far as I am aware, the website can still be slow at loading profiles or sometimes get stuck while loading, the pillory page still slides all the controls up when you scroll more then 10 posts or so down with NO button to go back to the top not to mention all the issues listed above. 

Blocking feature? People have been wanting for more then a year, emergency unlock? That has been 2 years. Their has been no clear public announcements as to what, if anything is currently under development. The last Development news, aside from the recent findom update, was a community meeting back in november 2022. Nor has their been any update to why safety features are taking years to be developed outside of my conversations directly with Vince. 

Even then, Vince has left some of messages and questions unanswered. I asked him why it felt like development resources where being spent in ways that felt like pushing for new features instead of safety features. I received no response. I also asked/stated that communication felt lacking and so it makes my voice and feedback feel like they land on deaf ears. Their was no response. It would be really nice if their was more communication and transparency with development and things behind the scenes.

<h1 align="center">Too Long, didn't Read</h1>

Phew okay that was a lot, now for the short version! Chaster is Chasity holding platform that has been around for about two and a half years. Despite this, and the fact that people have been asking for basic user safety tools like a blocking function [for over a year](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/833171605366243330/1121883459875516497/Discord_vSRvuRuHgt.png) Chaster has still not made it a top priority and is only committing to working on it Q4 this year. An emergency unlock option has also been requested over 2 years ago but it still has not been added, with one of the moderators stating [they do not even believe it is a good idea to have an emergency unlock option at all](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/833171605366243330/1121914696325406862/brave_hmBfNkJDKO.png). Chaster has also lacked good communication as of late to their development plans with the only recent news being a change to make findom require a chaster plus subscription to even use the website for findom use. This is on top of the restriction of not being allowed to reach out to other wearers as they can be terminated.

This has left me, and several other users to grow frustrated at the platform causing them to feel unsafe and leave all together.

<h1 align="center">Alterative Platforms</h1>

Although Chaster is one of the better Chasity holding platform in some regards it is far from the only one. If you do not want to use Chaster their are other here are some other platforms you can use instead: 

#### [emlalock](https://www.emlalock.com/)

This is one of the older website in the Chasity holding space. For better or for worse the website is a bit, quirky but it at least has themes. Some features are very customizable like the wheel of fortune but in order to use interactive elements with other users you need to verify yourself. In order to do this you need to verify yourself with a digital ID or spend a few dollars to verify with a selfie or a photo of a government issued ID. YIkes! But given this website has an emergency password option and you cant chat with others unless you verify this seems like the next best option for most users. 

#### [teamlocked.men](https://teamlocked.men/)

This site is more like a social media then a lock holding website. You can not even submit a photo or a lock code to lock up with. However user profiles are the most expanded upon in any Chasity related platforms I have seen. Heck you can even make blog posts! Interestingly, this is made by the same team as emlalock but feels completely different. This is more calendar based as well then any other platform. Not to menton their are some cool games to play around with. This is a decent option if you are okay not having your keys locked away under a lock box or code.


#### [chastisafe](https://chastisafe.com/#help)

This is another very intriguing website. This is very Discord centered, it does not have its own accounts, it uses your Discord account instead. The UI is lackluster and is a pain to use on mobile. However, it really plays into the game aspect like no other site. You can create complex card games around your lock ups. If you are okay with the UI and want to learn more this could be an excellent option. Oh did we mention it also lets you block users?


#### [Chastilock](https://twitter.com/Chastilock)

This seems to be a new platform that aside from this twitter profile we do not know much about. Figured it was worth mentioning.

#### [Lock-bot](https://sharing.clickup.com/9003150356/b/h/6-900302002559-2/f0d9effd2334748)

This is my own project so I left it for last. Its a safety first focused Discord bot that only supports self locks but already has support for blocking and an emergency unlock. Only time will tell if this project becomes a viable option.

These are all the other options I know about, feel free to let me know if I missed any, I would genuinely be curious to hear about more!

<h1 align="center">Closing Thoughts</h1>

To me it is a shame that Chaster is this way. It gets so many things right but yet gets so many basic user safety features wrong. Chaster feels like its suck in a weird place, in between making money and making enough money to support a full time developer. Despite this and the fact the platform grew faster then anticipated it is incredibly frustrating to see Chaster not shift its gears towards user safety and remain at this "good enough" but not fully state for such a long time. 

I would also like to make it clear that reason for this document is just to push Chaster to take user safety more seriously and to make steps in the right direction. I do not want for it to come to this but I feel my voice is not heard otherwise. I am not doing for this personal gain, just for the safety of others nor am i trying to rip apart any kind of community, I just want to see a meaningful change. 

If you read it this far, thank you so much, I hope it was worth the read and incite. If you would like to talk to me reach reach out to me at Shy_fox on chaster, I still read my DMs even if I no longer use the platform or [create an issue on github](https://github.com/shy-foxo/chaster-is-an-unsafe-platform/issues/new).
