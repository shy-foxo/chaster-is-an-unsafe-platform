<h1 align="center">Chaster; A Great Platform That Does Not Care</h1>

> This is going to be be a very long read, there is a [TLDR](https://github.com/shy-foxo/chaster-is-an-unsafe-platform) at the bottom.

Chaster is a Chasity lock holding website, arguably one of the best ones out there. Between it's user friendly UI, useful features and games, the ability to work across PC and mobile devices, it's no wounder it has gained massive popularity. However, not everything is rainbows and sunshine. Chaster lacks some basic user safety tools and in one case, a moderator has even stated they do not want safety features added. Lets talk about it!

<h1 align="center">The Lack of a Blocking Function</h1>

One of the many great things about Chaster is its plethora community and intractable lock features. From shared links that other users or guests can vote to add or remove time on, to a verification system that lets users vote to verify you are still locked, and even a pillory where users vote to either add time or on what tasks you should complete. Given Chaster's size one might think their is a way to stop certain users from interacting with you and your lock right? Outside of the "ignore conversation" button for user chats their is no way to stop users from interacting with you or your locks. The story is the same for shard locks, a way for users to create and share privately or publicly locks they have created.

Is there anything users can do at all? For shared links function, users can see who added or removed time so, in theory users could simply reverse the action of users they do not want interacting with their lock. This is far from ideal however, users can vote once every 24 hours nor is their an option to even be able to reset the link for users to vote on! The only other option in this case would be to just flat out disable the feature.

Verification photos and pillory is even worse. Their is NO way at all to see who voted for what. This means that users you do not want interacting with you can interact all they please with no way for you to find out they are even doing so. While one could disable these features altogether, this is at best temporary fix at best and ignores the underlying issue. Users should be able to control what users can and can not interact with them.

Shared locks are much the same story, this feature allows users to pre make locks that can be shared privately or publicly. Their is an option to require a password to start a shared lock but this only goes so far. If a shared lock is public, any user can join them at any time. Their is nothing you can do to stop only specific users from joining them. You can effectively end a lock once a user starts it, however their is nothing preventing the user from starting the lock again. Being forced to use a password on your shared locks not only increases friction to start a shared lock, but in some cases can ruin the whole idea of the lock. Take for example trap locks, the idea behind these is you join for a short amount of time and hope you get out before the lock creator finds and "traps" you. If you need to ask for a password to even start the lock.. well then they will know you plan to join it effectively ruining the whole game.

The idea of a blocking function is not a new idea to Chaster either. From what I can find, someone suggested adding a blocking feature on 1/25/22, thats over one year ago. The topic of not being able to stop users from interacting with certain element's of the lock came up many times before then. Even on their own feedback website their are two posts, one from 9 months ago and one from 5 months ago asking for a blocking function. While it might be understandable that a blocking feature would not exist in a beta, Chaster is no longer considering itself to be a beta, more on this later. 

![user asking for blocking feature on 1/25/22](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/833171605366243330/1121883459875516497/Discord_vSRvuRuHgt.png)

![post created 9 months ago asking for a blocking feature](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/833171605366243330/1121883641702781008/brave_Bjbm6KW8sz.png)

![2nd post created 5 months ago also asking for a blocking feature](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/833171605366243330/1121883805498736661/brave_G6d7n56oVG.png)

To make matters worse chaster is not even a new platform! From Vince's words "Chaster is now online for two and a half years, and has grown significantly, faster than I expected." Who is Vince you might ask? "I'm (Vince) the only active developer. Aaron is working with me on technical stuff and hosting, but I'm the only one working on the code as of today." I have talked with Vince a few times about the lack of a blocking function and here is what he has had to say: 

!["Hi! To reply to your message on general chat: we plan to work on new social profile features in Q4 this year (improving user profile, add additional fields), and we plan during this project to add a real blocking system. It's not trivial to create this system as we need to block every interaction (pillory, votes, session link, messaging, profile display, locks). For information, this project has some technical requirements that we plan to do earlier in Q3 (new search system), that's why we don't have a blocking system yet.
But it's planned in our internal roadmap, and obviously it's an important feature for a messaging app."](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/833171605366243330/1121886780371767326/brave_tBxj1eSTuM.png)

![A longer message going into more details, tldr, "I am the only active dev, we are planning to add it but its not easy to make and I plan to make a few functions first before we add this"](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/833171605366243330/1121887523124281364/brave_xAbNQz5LNL.png)

So, despite all of the requests and the need for a blocking system, its not planned until Q4 2023. Yikes! There are some things I want to note here. 

> "However we need to address some tech requirements firsts, **including the search system to improve performance**, as I'm sure you don't want a blocking system with a laggy experience."

This one strikes me as very strange. For starters, from my understand he is talking about the search function that can be found inside the messages section of the website. From my experience... it works just fine. Not fast, not perfect but just fine. The second thing is "I'm sure you don't want a blocking system with a laggy experience." Their is already an ignore user function, why cant a block user option be added right below it? I believe most of the time users would want to block someone they will probably have some kind of interaction with the user. Assuming their is a block function in messages and or on the users profile it would be easy to find the user based on a previous or current interaction to block them. And as stated before their is a search feature that does indeed work if you still can not find them. I just do not understand this logic at all.

I understand that adding in a proper blocking feature will take many parts because it will have to work across many parts of the platform. This was my suggestion:

![Me suggesting the simple logic in my head on how to go about solving this](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/833171605366243330/1121892855925968990/brave_AdIlD6FcFQ.png)

If you are confused by what I am saying don't worry. I have no idea if this was a good or bad suggestion because his response was... none, none at all. He never messaged me back. 

My main point still stands. Their has been plenty of time to shift development into working on these features instead. Over a year in fact, but his current plan is still not prioritize this and put it after other features later this year. If he truly understands the importance of it why has nothing been done sooner? Why is it still not a top priority? Even one of the lead moderators has stated "Yup. I agree it's sorely needed. But not that it's the literal highest priority". It would seem no matter how much feedback or need their is "I'm sure I'm (Vince) better placed to know what to prioritize on the app I'm developing."

The Chaster team likes to point to the moderation team as the current solution to this but the moderation team is not the end all be all. Chaster is tightly integrated around Discord, they have a very active server, you can get DM logs on Discord about your locks and messages, and you can even have you Discord username displayed and updated automatically. THe problem is this means that a lot of things happen off platform from chaster, and screen shots can be faked. So, it is understandable that the moderation team can only do so much in a lot of cases. While reporting problematic users is still important, letting users have control over their own accounts and letting them control who and who can not interact with them is paramount. 

Chaster knows this is a problem, not only have they acknowledged it they even recently made a post warning users about it

![Post warning about bad actors on the platform](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/833171605366243330/1121897449452216350/Discord_e22Ez0Qft2.png)

And yet the biggest solution is only a promise to come later this year, despite the fact users have been asking for it for over a year.

<h1 align="center">The Lack of an Emergency Unlock</h1>

When you create a lock on Chaster you are presented with 2 options, upload an image or create a combination.

![Screen shot showing the prompt above](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/833171605366243330/1121898958713802824/brave_PnFtoVw6yE.png)

This is because Chaster assumes you have some means to lock your keys up with, normally this is done with a lock box. This is all fine and dandy right? If you create a lock with your keys locked up surely this is some way to unlock yourself and get free in an Emergency right? Wrong! This function does not exist at all. In fact its been suggested! 

![user suggesting emergency unlock option](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/833171605366243330/1121901025079599165/brave_3MCFEW3HSJ.png)

But this suggestion was denied, because it will be abused by people not serious about Chastity! I can understand if this suggestion is not perfect because it leaves the lock "frozen" but surely an emergency that ends the lock would be fine? Currently as it stands if you end or as Chaster puts it "Abandon" a lock it will NOT give you your lock code. Your only options are to rely on a hygiene opening as your emergency unlock, make an alt account and give it keyholder permissions to let you out or ask the Chaster moderation team. 

Surely you can select no option at all right? Wrong! In fact someone else suggested this and wouldn't you know it this suggest was also denied.

![The above suggestion](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/833171605366243330/1121904989246332969/brave_gsVMC2TXxD.png)

This also infuriates me. This is not a "very edge case". Lots of users, I would argue probably most get a lock box *after* they get a cage or other Chasity device. Assuming that everyone has a method to lock their keys up is bonkers to me. If anything, wouldn't inexperienced users need the option to unlock at a moments notice __even more__ then an experienced user? This logic is absolutely bonkers to me. Coding wise the only thing that should be stopping this from being an option is removing a code requirement before starting a lock and making sure the program can expect no code when it would normally show the user a code. That's about it.

At the very least it is good that their is at least the option of going to the moderator team to ask for a code if need be, but why not having an emergency release system not standard is absolutely beyond me. Let alone a suggestion that gets denied. A friend of mine has left the platform over this feature alone. If chaster is serious about "the security of our users is indeed our top priority" which is a direct quote from Vince, why is this not a thing? However I will mention they are planning on adding an emergency unlock with a password which is fine enough I guess. Expect, as far as I can tell this has been in their back log for OVER 2 years and one the head mods of Chaster does not even think it should be an option at all.

![The suggestion on their feedbacks site asking for an emergency password](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/833171605366243330/1121914696325406862/brave_hmBfNkJDKO.png)

"nor do I like the idea of any sort of emergency unlock" This absolutely infuriates me! Chaster is a public platform, so it is understandable that people with all levels of experience will be using this platform. The fact the do not want ANY kind of emergency unlock is just insane to me. I fully agree with LycraShortzUK here, not only should this already be a feature but the fact that a moderator from Chaster thinks it should not exist at all is quite frankly gross. This is ironic giving this is the mod who sings the praises of "Safe, Sane, Consensual." It is bold to assume all users have access to another breakable lock for emergency's when quite frankly not all users have access to a lock box as is. At least 99 other users felt this suggestion was worth an upvote despite this.

The last item I want to mention here is that the option to submit a code of your own is "planned". This can be used to submit photos of your keys or cage locked with a single use sealed lock with a random string on it. I would show a photo of this but I honestly can not find it again in the feedback site. If you do find it please let me know so I can update this section!

<h1 align="center">The Handling of Findom Locks</h1>

Another recent issue Chaster has had has been Findom locks. If you do not know what Findom is that is okay! The first screen shot gives a good explainer of what it is better then I could probably put it

![findom explained from the urban dictionary](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/833171605366243330/1121936387558608907/brave_BrzA2JswBR.png)

And here is how Chaster is handling the problem: 

![Chaster's announcement about how they are handling it, this can be found on their website under the change log tab](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/833171605366243330/1121936612390092850/Discord_PP9mWkzFxG.png)

I will be upfront and say that I am not into Findom and I have not used Chaster for the past few months for the reasons listed above and below. I am however a little septical about how they are handling this change. Mainly about this part: 

![Findoms are required to be apart of chaster plus](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/833171605366243330/1121941523110567936/brave_yP4EKl3jcK.png)

If their is money to be made then buying this is just the cost of doing business. I say this because it feels like the move [twitter did with the blue check mark](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2022/11/14/twitter-parody-accounts-cause-chaos/10696646002/). If a scammer needs to spend a little money to make a lot of money it is just the cost of doing businesses. Not only this but it also might make scammers harder to tell from real people because they might fall into the trap of thinking every user who pays is a legitimate user. 

This choice just feels pushed and I am not sure its the best option to go about this. Sure it could be seen better then outright banning it from the platform but Chaster is restrictive about it. They also state that if someone reaches out who is marked as a findom, meaning they have ANY lock marked as such then they could get their account terminated for it. I have one friend who is into Findom and their option is "its stupid" and they also agreed that making findoms pay for it does not make findoms any better.

This does not even mention that you could pay for it just to get no one to use your locks. Nor could you reach out even unrelated for risk of being terminated. I do think making locks more clear that they are findom lock is a good change but only time will tell if this change works well for the better as it has yet to fully take affect. If you want to learn more about this change I also highly recommend looking at their [documentation and faq](https://docs.chaster.app/locks/findom/) on findom. 


<h1 align="center">Chaster's Lack of Communication</h1>

Chaster also has been lacking good communication especially from the development team. For example, a lot of these augments could be countered with the site is still in beta. Expect... its not. When this change was made I am honestly not sure, it was seemly changed overnight. All I can say is it happened between April 18 2022 and June 4th 2023. 

![Chaster's change log with the dates pointed out](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/833171605366243330/1121970530816368750/k16X0XOvdI.png)

What happened between update 0.24 and beta 12.5 is anyone's guess. You would think that moving out of beta would be huge news or at least worthy of some kind of announcement but their has been none at all. As for why this changed was made overnight with no announcement is only something I can guess at. Presumably this was to make the platform feel more finished and to feel like you are truly buying into a service and not a early beta. But as far as I am aware, the website can still be slow at loading profiles or sometimes get stuck while loading, the pillory page still slides all the controls up when you scroll more then 10 posts or so down with NO button to go back to the top not to mention all the issues listed above. 

Blocking feature? People have been wanting for more then a year, emergency unlock? That has been 2 years. Their has been no clear public announcements as to what, if anything is currently under development. The last Development news, aside from the recent findom update, was a community meeting back in november 2022. Nor has their been any update to why safety features are taking years to be developed outside of my conversations directly with Vince. 

Even then, Vince has left some of messages and questions unanswered. I asked him why it felt like development resources where being spent in ways that felt like pushing for new features instead of safety features. I received no response. I also asked/stated that communication felt lacking and so it makes my voice and feedback feel like they land on deaf ears. Their was no response. It would be really nice if their was more communication and transparency with development and things behind the scenes.

<h1 align="center">Too Long, didn't Read</h1>

Phew okay that was a lot, now for the short version! Chaster is Chasity holding platform that has been around for about two and a half years. Despite this, and the fact that people have been asking for basic user safety tools like a blocking function [for over a year](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/833171605366243330/1121883459875516497/Discord_vSRvuRuHgt.png) Chaster has still not made it a top priority and is only committing to working on it Q4 this year. An emergency unlock option has also been requested over 2 years ago but it still has not been added, with one of the moderators stating [they do not even believe it is a good idea to have an emergency unlock option at all](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/833171605366243330/1121914696325406862/brave_hmBfNkJDKO.png). Chaster has also lacked good communication as of late to their development plans with the only recent news being a change to make findom require a chaster plus subscription to even use the website for findom use. This is on top of the restriction of not being allowed to reach out to other wearers as they can be terminated.

This has left me, and several other users to grow frustrated at the platform causing them to feel unsafe and leave all together.

<h1 align="center">Alterative Platforms</h1>

Although Chaster is one of the better Chasity holding platform in some regards it is far from the only one. If you do not want to use Chaster their are other here are some other platforms you can use instead: 

#### [emlalock](https://www.emlalock.com/)

This is one of the older website in the Chasity holding space. For better or for worse the website is a bit, quirky but it at least has themes. Some features are very customizable like the wheel of fortune but in order to use interactive elements with other users you need to verify yourself. In order to do this you need to verify yourself with a digital ID or spend a few dollars to verify with a selfie or a photo of a government issued ID. YIkes! But given this website has an emergency password option and you cant chat with others unless you verify this seems like the next best option for most users. 

#### [teamlocked.men](https://teamlocked.men/)

This site is more like a social media then a lock holding website. You can not even submit a photo or a lock code to lock up with. However user profiles are the most expanded upon in any Chasity related platforms I have seen. Heck you can even make blog posts! Interestingly, this is made by the same team as emlalock but feels completely different. This is more calendar based as well then any other platform. Not to menton their are some cool games to play around with. This is a decent option if you are okay not having your keys locked away under a lock box or code.


#### [chastisafe](https://chastisafe.com/#help)

This is another very intriguing website. This is very Discord centered, it does not have its own accounts, it uses your Discord account instead. The UI is lackluster and is a pain to use on mobile. However, it really plays into the game aspect like no other site. You can create complex card games around your lock ups. If you are okay with the UI and want to learn more this could be an excellent option. Oh did we mention it also lets you block users?


#### [Chastilock](https://twitter.com/Chastilock)

This seems to be a new platform that aside from this twitter profile we do not know much about. Figured it was worth mentioning.

#### [Lock-bot](https://sharing.clickup.com/9003150356/b/h/6-900302002559-2/f0d9effd2334748)

This is my own project so I left it for last. Its a safety first focused Discord bot that only supports self locks but already has support for blocking and an emergency unlock. Only time will tell if this project becomes a viable option.

These are all the other options I know about, feel free to let me know if I missed any, I would genuinely be curious to hear about more!

<h1 align="center">Closing Thoughts</h1>

To me it is a shame that Chaster is this way. It gets so many things right but yet gets so many basic user safety features wrong. Chaster feels like its suck in a weird place, in between making money and making enough money to support a full time developer. Despite this and the fact the platform grew faster then anticipated it is incredibly frustrating to see Chaster not shift its gears towards user safety and remain at this "good enough" but not fully state for such a long time. 

I would also like to make it clear that reason for this document is just to push Chaster to take user safety more seriously and to make steps in the right direction. I do not want for it to come to this but I feel my voice is not heard otherwise. I am not doing for this personal gain, just for the safety of others nor am i trying to rip apart any kind of community, I just want to see a meaningful change. 

If you read it this far, thank you so much, I hope it was worth the read and incite. If you would like to talk to me reach reach out to me at Shy_fox on chaster, I still read my DMs even if I no longer use the platform or [create an issue on github](https://github.com/shy-foxo/chaster-is-an-unsafe-platform/issues/new).
